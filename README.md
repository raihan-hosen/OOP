# OOP with C++ 🚀

This repository contains my **C++ learning journey**, starting from **basic programming concepts (arrays & structures)** and gradually moving into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It is built through hands-on practice, university exercises, and self-study.

---

## 📌 Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

* To build a **strong foundation in C++** step by step
* To learn **arrays and structures before OOP** (core prerequisites)
* To practice and apply **Object-Oriented Programming concepts**
* To organize my **university/class exercises** in one place
* To track my learning progress over time

---

## 🧠 Learning Path

This repository follows a **progressive learning order**:

1. **Basic C++ Concepts**

   * Variables & data types
   * Input / Output
   * Control statements

2. **Arrays**

   * 1D & 2D arrays
   * Array operations
   * Passing arrays to functions

3. **Structures**

   * Structure basics
   * Array of structures
   * Structures vs classes

4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

   * Classes and Objects
   * Constructors and Destructors
   * Encapsulation
   * Inheritance
   * Polymorphism
   * Abstraction
   * Access Specifiers
   * Static Members
   * Friend Functions & Classes
   * Operator Overloading
   * Basic File Handling
